I am working through the book "The C Programming Language - Second Edition."

This repository just stores some code that I have used to help me learn through this book.

##Book

The C Programming Language - Second Edition can be found [here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/C-Programming-Language-2nd/dp/0131103628)

I also took a look at this book too.

"C Programming: A Modern Approach" by K.N.King has useful exercises at the end of the chapter, and seems like a great book, [here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/C-Programming-Modern-Approach-King/dp/0393979504) is a link to its amazon page.
