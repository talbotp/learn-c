# learn-c

I am working through some exercises in "C Programming: A Modern Approach" just to learn some C and some lower level programming. 

Am uploading some of the exercises they recommend as I read through the book.

## Book

"C Programming: A Modern Approach" by K.N.King has useful exercises at the end of the chapter, and seems like a great book, [here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/C-Programming-Modern-Approach-King/dp/0393979504)
 is a link to it's amazon page.
